# Decode text animation (on hover)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/creativeocean/pen/JjemXGY](https://codepen.io/creativeocean/pen/JjemXGY).

Has it been done 100s of times before? Yes. Still, I had fun building my own 'decode text' effect. Default animation is from left to right, but you can add the class 'fromRight' to make it go in reverse.# decode-text-animation
